                <p>A security token is a digital representation of ownership in an underlying real-world asset, such as real estate, company shares, or other financial instruments. Unlike utility tokens, security tokens are regulated financial securities that provide legal rights and protections to investors.</p>

                <h3>Why choose Security Tokens for real estate?</h3>
                <p>Security tokens provide the legal framework necessary for real estate investment by ensuring proper ownership rights, regulatory compliance, and investor protections. They enable fractional ownership of high-value assets while maintaining the legal standards expected in traditional real estate transactions.</p>

                <h3>What rights do Security Token holders have?</h3>
                <p>Security token holders typically have economic rights to rental income and property appreciation, voting rights on major decisions, and legal protections under securities laws. The specific rights are detailed in the token offering documents and governed by the SPV operating agreement.</p>

                <h3>How is investor protection ensured?</h3>
                <p>Investor protection is provided through multiple layers: regulatory oversight by UAE authorities, legal structuring through properly constituted SPVs, transparent reporting requirements, and the application of traditional securities laws to digital asset transactions.</p>

                <h3>What are the liquidity advantages?</h3>
                <p>Security tokens enable secondary market trading of real estate interests, providing liquidity traditionally unavailable in direct property ownership. While subject to securities transfer restrictions, tokens can be traded on regulated platforms, significantly reducing holding periods and improving capital efficiency.</p>

Distributions are typically made in stablecoins or other designated currencies.</p>
